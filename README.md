# Go Booking App – Learning Project

Welcome to the **Go Booking App** repository!  
This project is designed as a hands-on journey to learn Go (Golang) from the basics to advanced concepts, using a practical ticket booking application as the main example.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- Go program structure, variables, constants, and data types
- User input, control flow (if/else, loops), and functions
- Slices and structs for storing bookings
- Error handling and modularization
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels
- File I/O for saving bookings
- Unit testing in Go

## 🛠️ Project Structure

```
booking-app/
├── main.go         # Main application logic
├── helper.go       # Helper functions and types
├── bookings.txt    # Saved bookings (generated at runtime)
├── booking_test.go # Unit tests
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install Go**: [Download and install Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. **Clone this repo**:  
   `git clone <your-repo-url>`
3. **Run the app**:  
   `go run .`
4. **Run tests**:  
   `go test`
5. **To initialize the go**
   `go mod init <application-name>`   

## 📝 Learning Roadmap

This repo follows a structured learning path:
- **Phase 1:** Go basics, input/output, variables, expressions
- **Phase 2:** Control flow (if/else, loops, functions)
- **Phase 3:** Data structures (slices, structs, maps, pointers)
- **Phase 4:** Intermediate (interfaces, error handling, packages, file I/O, testing)
- **Phase 5:** Advanced (concurrency, channels, select, mutex, context)
- **Phase 6:** Practical (CLI tools, REST APIs, modules)
- **Phase 7:** Deployment (formatting, linting, Docker, cross-compilation)

## 💡 How to Use

- Read the code and comments in each file.
- Follow the step-by-step learning notes provided in this repo and in your learning sessions.
- Experiment by modifying the code and adding new features.
